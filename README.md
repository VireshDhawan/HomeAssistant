### The artificial, ever helpful, butler.

A voice controlled home assistant that I, among other functionalities, use to control the lights in my apartment and get weather details from. The graphical web interface is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the backend server is built in Python, using Flask. I have used Google's Speech API for speech recognition on the client side and the Wit AI framework for natural language processing. The home assistant uses responsivevoice.js to communicate back verbally.
